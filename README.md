# Pro-Run

**Durable continuous execution for tool-using language models.**

Pro-Run turns a stateless model call into a recoverable execution process: events wake work, durable state survives process restarts, relevant memory is injected into context, model turns are constrained to structured tool calls or a final answer, and external mutations are fenced behind idempotency and reconciliation rules.

The repository description calls this a continuous execution environment for LLM autonomy. In concrete terms, Pro-Run provides **process-level autonomy while a Pro-Run daemon is actually running**. It does not imply hidden activity when no process is running, model consciousness, unrestricted authority, or permission to perform effects a host has not granted.

## What V1 provides

- SQLite/WAL durable state with a lease-based event queue.
- Event deduplication and recovery after expired worker leases.
- Interval schedules that emit idempotent events.
- Durable runs and run transcripts across model turns.
- Salience/relevance-based memory selection under a bounded context budget.
- A provider-neutral model interface plus a minimal OpenAI-compatible adapter.
- Structured tool admission by explicit capability.
- Exactly one admitted tool call per model turn for deterministic effect ordering.
- A durable mutation ledger keyed by request ID and canonical request digest.
- Replay of already committed mutation results without re-executing the effect.
- `BLOCKED_EFFECT` recovery when a mutation outcome becomes ambiguous.
- Explicit reconciliation before retry of an ambiguous effect.
- Append-only lifecycle journal entries for queue claims and recovery evidence.
- A small daemon and CLI for submitting, scheduling, inspecting, and running work.

## Core invariant

Reasoning is retryable. External effects are not assumed retryable.

```text
REQUEST != AUTHORITY != ATTEMPT != EFFECT != VERIFIED EFFECT
```

If a mutation handler loses its response after dispatch, Pro-Run records `ATTEMPTED_UNKNOWN`, stops that run, and refuses blind replay. A host must reconcile whether the effect occurred. If it did, the committed result is replayed; if it did not, Pro-Run retries the exact stored request rather than asking the model to invent a replacement call.

## Portfolio-derived design

Before implementation, the full accessible `thebrazenbeard` portfolio was swept at repository level: **70 repositories** were inventoried and their current README surfaces inspected. High-value public donors were then inspected more deeply. Pro-Run is self-contained; donor repositories are architecture/provenance inputs, not runtime dependencies.

The strongest donor mechanisms were:

- `project-runner`: work units, leases, deterministic deduplication, durable dispatch, exact-subject currentness, bounded retry.
- `wip`: crash recovery, checkpoints, recovery/effect lifecycle separation.
- `ccb-core` and `intranel`: canonical envelopes, routing, dedupe, journal/reconciliation discipline.
- `ingest`: deterministic intake, provenance, receipts, raw-vs-derived separation.
- `temporal`: simple append-only time/event semantics.
- `driftguard`: monotonic durable state, compare-and-swap thinking, evidence-bound recovery.
- `WorkBridgeMCP`: capability narrowing, bounded execution, identity checks around effects.
- `vera-mesh`: mutation-ledger idempotency and fail-closed replay safety.
- `vera-mono`: unresolved-effect recovery barrier and explicit effect/readback distinctions.

The complete public-safe audit is in [docs/PORTFOLIO_SWEEP_V1.md](docs/PORTFOLIO_SWEEP_V1.md). Private repositories were included in the internal sweep but are not named or reproduced in this public repository.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
```

Submit a durable task:

```bash
pro-run --state .pro-run/state.db submit \
  "Summarize the queued work" \
  --capability files.read
```

Run one cycle against an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint:

```bash
export PRO_RUN_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export PRO_RUN_MODEL="your-model"
# export PRO_RUN_API_KEY="..."  # only when your endpoint requires one

pro-run --state .pro-run/state.db run-once
```

Run continuously:

```bash
pro-run --state .pro-run/state.db daemon --poll-seconds 1
```

Schedule a recurring task:

```bash
pro-run --state .pro-run/state.db schedule \
  "Review the durable queue" \
  --every 300
```

The CLI intentionally does not expose arbitrary shell execution. Host applications register their own tools through `ToolRegistry`, with each tool bound to a named capability and an explicit `mutation` classification.

## Library sketch

```python
from prorun.context import ContextAssembler
from prorun.engine import Engine
from prorun.store import Store
from prorun.tools import ToolRegistry, ToolSpec

store = Store("state.db")
tools = ToolRegistry(store)

tools.register(
    ToolSpec(
        name="inventory.read",
        description="Read inventory state",
        input_schema={"type": "object", "required": ["sku"]},
        capability="inventory.read",
        mutation=False,
    ),
    lambda args: {"sku": args["sku"], "quantity": 4},
)

# Supply any object implementing ModelAdapter, then create Engine(...).
```

Mutating handlers should return JSON-serializable dictionaries. If a mutation throws after ledger admission, Pro-Run treats its outcome as ambiguous rather than assuming nothing happened.

## Non-goals

V1 is not a distributed consensus system, a universal authorization service, a sandbox for untrusted code, a secret manager, or proof that an external effect occurred merely because a tool handler returned success. It also does not make a model continuously active unless a host process is running the daemon.
