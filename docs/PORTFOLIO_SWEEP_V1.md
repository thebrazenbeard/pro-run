# Portfolio Full-Sweep Audit V1

Observed: 2026-09-25
Owner scope: `thebrazenbeard`
Target: `pro-run`

## Method

The accessible portfolio was enumerated from GitHub, yielding 70 repositories. The current default-branch README surface of every repository was inspected for mechanisms relevant to continuous execution: durable state, daemon/worker behavior, eventing, scheduling, queues, memory/context, structured tools, routing, idempotency, recovery, leases, heartbeats, effect boundaries, runtime policy, and verification.

Repositories with a strong match were then inspected at tree/source level for exact candidate mechanisms. The sweep is architecture discovery, not evidence that every donor is installed, current at runtime, or suitable for direct code copying.

Because `pro-run` is public, private repositories remain privacy-bound. The internal sweep included them, but this public artifact publishes only aggregate counts and public repository findings.

Inventory: **70 total = 54 public + 16 private** at the time of the sweep.

## Classification

- **PRIMARY** — directly informed V1 implementation invariants.
- **SECONDARY** — useful mechanism or operating pattern; incorporated narrowly or reserved as an extension seam.
- **REFERENCE** — conceptually related, but no V1 runtime dependency or direct mechanism admitted.
- **NONCORE** — domain-specific, historical, scaffold, or otherwise not needed for the execution kernel.
- **TARGET** — `pro-run` itself.

## Admitted V1 architecture

The sweep did **not** produce a mega-runtime that imports the portfolio. It produced a smaller kernel with these admitted mechanisms:

1. one self-contained SQLite durability boundary;
2. lease-based durable event ownership;
3. deterministic schedule occurrence IDs and event dedupe;
4. persistent runs and bounded step counts;
5. explicit memory/context budget;
6. structured one-tool-call-per-turn model contract;
7. capability-scoped tool visibility and execution;
8. request-digest idempotency for mutations;
9. `BLOCKED_EFFECT` on ambiguous mutation outcomes;
10. exact-request recovery after external reconciliation;
11. append-only lifecycle journal;
12. provider and tool adapters as replaceable host seams.

## Deferred ideas

Useful portfolio mechanisms intentionally deferred from V1 include distributed workers/backends, multi-node heartbeats, recursive work decomposition, portfolio dependency graphs, external attestation, richer semantic retrieval, priority/salience learning, and provider-specific execution transports. They are extension candidates, not missing prerequisites for the V1 kernel.
